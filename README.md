# Piola
Piola aims at mimetising SolverGP to provide a simple, C++, opensource alternative to it. I developed during my PhD at LNCC (2015-2019) for debug purposes. Please consider compilating a version of GPMaterials in a .so file, to be able to call the library from Piola. This version specifically relies on a valid Armadillo instalation for linearalgebra routines.
